      <h2>Discord Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Don't Be an Ass</h3>
          <p>
            This rule is very simple and intentionally vague. Don't be
            rude/nasty towards another member. If you have an issue with
            someone, take it into DMs or message an <a href="">admin</a>. This
            is a safe place and we will not accept bullying of any kind.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Discrimination</h3>
          <p>
            The server has a 0 tolerance on discrimination. This means do no
            racism, sexism, homophobia or any other unfair judgement of another
            member or group. This is very important as we have many members here
            from a variety of cultures and backgrounds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Use of Slurs</h3>
          <p>
            Slurs are not allowed on the server. In essence if the word has
            defaming connotations such as making fun of someone's inhibitions or
            race, it is not permitted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>FFXIV and mods</h3>
          <p>
            The server recognises the FFXIV ToS. This means no advertisement or
            encouragement of botting or RMT. Use of ACT and posting modded
            screenshots (with player names censored) is permitted at your own
            discretion. Data-mined content is strictly prohibited.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>NSFW Content</h3>
          <p>
            Any media of 18+ nature is prohibited on the server except for in
            #nsfwðŸ”ž. This rule also extends to your server profile.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Discord ToS</h3>
          <p>
            It goes without saying that if you are using our server, you also
            agree to
            <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms" target="_blank"
              >Discord's own Terms of Service.</a
            >
            In the event that we are made aware that you have failed to comply,
            we will be forced to report you and remove you from our server
            permanently.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Relevance</h3>
          <p>
            We have a great deal of channels, all of which serve a unique
            purpose. Sometimes channels can go off-topic where there are more
            relevant channels for that conversation. If you are diverted or
            moved elsewhere, our team is just doing their job. Don't take it
            personally.
