    <h3>Welcome to Vanishing Journey's Official Discord server.</h3>
    <p>
      Vanishing Journey was created back in 2016 with the intent of being a fun
      place for people to gather, but it came to be inactive not soon after.
      Fast forward 5 years to 2021 and Vanishing Journey was reborn! Holding
      true to the core beliefs we had back then, it is intended to be a Free
      Company that anyone can call their home away from home. Be it within the
      game of Final Fantasy or even in other games. We all play together with a
      focus on enjoying each others presence over anything else. Be it for just
      your standard solo grinding or participation in big events, Vanishing
      Journey is an FC that wishes to provide you with friends along the way.

    <h2>Discord Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Don't Be an Ass</h3>
        <p>
          This rule is very simple and intentionally vague. Don't be rude/nasty
          towards another member. If you have an issue with someone, take it
          into DMs or message an <a href="">admin</a>. This is a safe place and
          we will not accept bullying of any kind.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Discrimination</h3>
        <p>
          The server has a 0 tolerance on discrimination. This means do no
          racism, sexism, homophobia or any other unfair judgement of another
          member or group. This is very important as we have many members here
          from a variety of cultures and backgrounds.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Use of Slurs</h3>
        <p>
          Slurs are not allowed on the server. In essence if the word has
          defaming connotations such as making fun of someone's inhibitions or
          race, it is not permitted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>FFXIV and mods</h3>
        <p>
          The server recognises the FFXIV ToS. This means no advertisement or
          encouragement of botting or RMT. Use of ACT and posting modded
          screenshots (with player names censored) is permitted at your own
          discretion. Data-mined content is strictly prohibited.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>NSFW Content</h3>
        <p>
          Any media of 18+ nature is prohibited on the server except for in
          #nsfwðŸ”ž. This rule also extends to your server profile.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Discord ToS</h3>
        <p>
          It goes without saying that if you are using our server, you also
          agree to
          <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms" target="_blank"
            >Discord's own Terms of Service.</a
          >
          In the event that we are made aware that you have failed to comply, we
          will be forced to report you and remove you from our server
          permanently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Relevance</h3>
        <p>
          We have a great deal of channels, all of which serve a unique purpose.
          Sometimes channels can go off-topic where there are more relevant
          channels for that conversation. If you are diverted or moved
          elsewhere, our team is just doing their job. Don't take it personally.
