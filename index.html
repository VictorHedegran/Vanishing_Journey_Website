    <h3>Welcome to Vanishing Journey's Official Discord server.</h3>
    <p>
      Vanishing Journey was created back in 2016 with the intent of being a fun
      place for people to gather, but it came to be inactive not soon after.
      Fast forward 5 years to 2021 and Vanishing Journey was reborn! Holding
      true to the core beliefs we had back then, it is intended to be a Free
      Company that anyone can call their home away from home. Be it within the
      game of Final Fantasy or even in other games. We all play together with a
      focus on enjoying each others presence over anything else. Be it for just
      your standard solo grinding or participation in big events, Vanishing
      Journey is an FC that wishes to provide you with friends along the way.

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Don't Be an Ass</h3>
        <p>
          This rule is very simple and intentionally vague. Be kind, considerate
          and level-headed. Don't be rude/nasty towards another member. If you
          have an issue with someone, take it into DMs, do not fight fire with
          fire in our channels. Consistently being passive aggressive, or clear
          attempts to make someone feel belittled or unwelcome won't be
          tolerated. This is a safe place and we will not accept bullying or
          hurtful intentions of any kind.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Discrimination</h3>
        <p>
          The server has a 0 tolerance on discrimination of any kind. This means
          do not be racist, sexist, homophobic or generally show any unfair
          judgement of another user or group. This is being called out
          separately to the above as we have many members from a variety of
          cultures.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Use of Slurs</h3>
        <p>
          Slurs are not allowed on the server. If they are used the message is
          usually auto-deleted by our bot. The words on this list can be
          requested in #ðŸ“–server-suggestions. Our concept on this is rather
          simple. If the word has defaming connotations such as making fun of
          someone's inhibitions or race for example, it is not permitted. If
          using that word is important to you, use it elsewhere. Some call this
          censorship, that's your opinion. To us, it's our attempt to make this
          server as comfortable as it possibly can be for everyone that joins
          us.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Game Rules</h3>
        <p>
          The server recognises the FFXIV ToS. This means no advertisement or
          encouragement of botting or RMT. We also recognise the use of ACT and
          this is permitted but at your own discretion. Posting modded
          screenshots is also permitted provided they are SFW. Users are not
          allowed to post data-mined content or NSFW screenshots. Names of
          players must also be censored if they are present in any of the above.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>NSFW Content</h3>
        <p>
          Any visual media or linking of an 18+ nature is prohibited everywhere
          on the server except for #nsfwðŸ”ž. This rule also extends to nicknames,
          profile pics and/or status updates visible on the server. No images or
          links can be posted. Any content deemed inappropriate in any channel
          will be removed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Discord ToS</h3>
        <p>
          It goes without saying that if you are using our server, you also
          agree to
          <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms" target="_blank"
            >Discord's own Terms of Service.</a
          >
          You are solely responsible as an individual to ensure you do not break
          Discords terms. In the event that we are made aware that you have, we
          will be forced to report you and remove you from our server
          permanently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Relevance</h3>
        <p>
          We have a great deal of channels, all of which serve a unique purpose.
          These channels' existence have been refined over time to its existing
          point where we feel there is a balance of filtering conversation into
          the appropriate places. Sometimes channels can go off-topic where
          there are more relevant channels for that conversation. If you are
          diverted or moved elsewhere, our team is just doing their job. Don't
          take it personally. Finally, if a channel's activity suddenly becomes
          so active it is unreadable and people cannot follow, slow mode may be
          enabled for a short period.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Inacitivity of Free company members</h3>
        <p>
          Ghost rank is given when you reach 30 days of inactivity and at 60
          days you will be kicked . You can still be in the discord as a Guest
          and you are always welcome back when you want to jump into the game
          again. This rule is to make sure that we keep our activity as a
          priority. ( a person who gave us a reason why they have to be inactive
          will bypass this rule by 15 days.)
